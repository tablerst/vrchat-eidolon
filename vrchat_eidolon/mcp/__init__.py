"""Internal MCP integration layer.

This package contains client/registry/policy code for integrating with external
MCP servers (e.g. VRChat OSC/chatbox tools).

Notes:
- The third-party MCP SDK remains importable as the top-level `mcp` package.
- The internal integration layer is namespaced under `vrchat_eidolon.mcp`.
